# Bodily Remixes

## Installation
Download FFmpeg on your system and add it to your path variable. Use an editor of your choice and make sure you have the latest version of python installed. Change the name of the audioApp.py to app.py or enter the following command to your powershell terminal: $env:FLASK_APP = "audioApp". Use the command python -m flask run to run the application. 

## Usage
Uplaod a song of your choice on the first page while dancing to it. Then, once you're satisfied with both the song and your moves, upload it to the backend server, where it will get split into chunks and your body movements will be analyzed. Finally, access the remixed version of the song by simply clicking on the audio file and downloading it to your local computer.
